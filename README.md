# Tomasulo's Algorithm Simulator

Advanced Computer Architecture<br />
Dynamically Scheduled Processor Simulator

For the final project of my Advanced Computer Architecture class, my partner and I developed a simulator of Tomasulo's algorithm within a GUI framework given to us by our professor. The program simulates Tomasulo's computer architecture hardware algorithm for dynamic scheduling of instructions enabling out-of-order execution. Our dynamically scheduled simulator saw a 594% speedup compared to our [pipelined processor simulator](https://github.com/tloula/pipelined-processor-simulator).
