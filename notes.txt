Questions for G:

I moved updateCDB from line 301 to line 293 of PipelineSimulator.java 
because I thought it emulated the hardware better. Is that OK?

// When adding in branching, need to add to these files/functions:
    reorderBuffer.java: retireInst 
    issueUnit.java: execCycle
    functionUnit.java: acceptIssue
    robEntry.java: copyInstData

    reservationStation.java: snoop


Do we handle the num of retirees correctly?
